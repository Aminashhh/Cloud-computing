- Be critical but professional.
- Use the terminology of Marty Cagan (e.g., "Empowered Teams," "Product Discovery").
1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Based on the review of the 2023 Integrated Annual Report and 3Q 2024 Strategy Presentation, Halyk Bank is currently operating as a "Digital Immigrant".
•	While the organization has successfully adopted surface-level Agile terminology ("Tribes", "Squads", "Ecosystem"), the underlying operating model remains rooted in an "IT Service" or "Project-based" mindset.
•	The bank is effectively running a Feature Factory: efficient at delivering outputs, but structurally inhibited from true product-led innovation due to legacy funding and management practices.
2. EVIDENCE OF "FEATURE FACTORY" BEHAVIOR (RISKS)
The following evidence from the provided documents indicates a "Mercenary" culture rather than a "Missionary" one:
A. Conflation of Product & Project Management
•	"Training sessions were conducted for product owners, Agile coaches and Chapter leads based on the Agile and Scrum methodologies... [and] project management methodology." (Annual Report 2023) 
•	Risk: In a true Product Operating Model, Product Owners are responsible for value and viability, not project schedule application. Training POs in "project management" reinforces the idea that their job is to "deliver on time" (Output) rather than "solve customer problems" (Outcome).
B. Celebration of "IT Projects" over "Product Businesses"
•	"GovTech: Best IT Project in E-Government" (Awards Section, Annual Report 2023) 
•	Risk: Treating technology initiatives as "IT Projects" implies a start and an end date, whereas successful digital products require continuous evolution. This framing cements IT as a cost center/service provider rather than the business itself.
C. Project-Based Funding Models
•	"The committee also reviewed the Bank’s draft budget for 2024 and the execution of the Bank’s budget for H1 2023." (Annual Report 2023) 
•	Risk: Evidence suggests traditional annual budgeting cycles dominate. Product-led companies use "Continuous Funding" (VC-style) based on business outcomes. Annual budgeting forces teams to lock in scope ("requirements") 12 months in advance, killing agility and innovation.
3. STRATEGIC DISCONNECTS
There is a clear disconnect between the Bank's strategic INTENT and its EXECUTION:
•	Intent: The bank clearly aims to build a lifestyle "Ecosystem" and "Super-App", comparable to digital natives like Kaspi.
•	Execution: The structure supports "Control" over "Innovation". The heavy emphasis on "IT investments" (cost view) and "delivering requirements" (servant view) suggests that the technology teams are mercenaries hired to build what the business asks for, rather than missionaries empowered to solve the customer's needs.
•	Conclusion: You cannot build a dynamic ecosystem with a static, project-based governance structure.
4. THE PRESCRIPTION
To shift from an "IT Service Model" to a true "Product Operating Model," the Board must mandate the following shifts:
1.	Shift from Projects to Products: Abolish "IT Projects" and annual project-based budgeting. Fund stable, persistent Product Teams (Tribes) annually, but release funds quarterly based on business outcomes (e.g., "Increase DAU by 10%", "Reduce Customer Acquisition Cost"), not feature delivery.
2.	Redefine the Role of Product: Stop training Product Owners in Project Management. Train them in Product Discovery (assessing value, usability, feasibility, viability). Empower them to say "no" to business requests that do not drive the desired outcome.
3.	Merge IT and Business: Dissolve the artificial barrier between "The Business" and "IT". Technology IS the business. Place engineers and badged "business" experts on the same teams with shared KPIs to foster a "Missionary" culture.
